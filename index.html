 <p> My Name is Elijah Williams, I'm 17 years old and currently live in Brooklyn, New York. I plan to pursue computer science for my career and day by day I'll do what I must to get where I need to be in life. My current vision is to puruse cybersecurity but, in the near future that may change. I am someone who can an introvert at times but I am someone who goes with the flow and very friendly.I also love the color blue.</p>
<p>Throughout my childhood I've always loved videogames and that led to the foundation of my newfound love for computer science.I also play chess at around an intermediate level, once being apart of my school's chess team. I'm currently in the process of learning how to drive, dedicating a good amount of time learning when I'm not doing the other things listed. When I'm not doing any of those other things I spend time with my family as I do enjoy making them laugh.</p>
<p>My main goal to get as far as I can in my career and also to end up enjoying what I do for an extended amount of time. To do that I must start early in my pursuit gaining as much knowledge and experience as I can to be prepared or when I'm on my own.</p>
